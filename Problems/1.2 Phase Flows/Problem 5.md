# Problem 5
Prove that the horizontal line $\mathbb{R} \times \{x\}, x \in M$, is an integral curve if and only if $x$ is an equilibrium position.

# Solution
Suppose it is not an equilibrium position then there exist $t, s \in \mathbb{R}, t \neq s$ such that
$$
(t, \varphi^t(x)) \neq (s, \varphi^s(x)).
$$
But because our phase space is the horizontal line we have
$$
\varphi^t(x) = x = \varphi^s(x)
$$
by uniqueness it follows that $t = s$ as such our integral curve is an equilibrium point.
