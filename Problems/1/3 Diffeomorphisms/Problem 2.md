# Problem
Proved that if $f : U \rightarrow V$ is a diffeomorphism, then the Euclidean spaces with the domains $U$ and $V$ as subsets have the same dimension.

Hint: Use the implicit function theorem.

# Solution
Suppose $f: U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n + m} \rightarrow V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$, we want to show that $n = 0$. Fix $p \in V$, w.l.o.g. (by shifting) we may assume that $p = 0$ holds.
